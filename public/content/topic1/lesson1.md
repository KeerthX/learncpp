# Data Types

In programming, data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Data types are broadly classified into three categories:

1. Primitive
2. Derived
3. User Defined

## 1. Primitive

Primitive data types are the most basic data types available within a language. They serve as the building blocks for data manipulation. Examples include:

- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers.
- **Float**: Represents numbers with fractional parts.
- **Character**: Represents single characters.
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.

## 2. Derived

Derived data types are types that are derived from the primitive data types. They include:

- **Function**: Represents a block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Array**: Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
- **Pointer**: Represents a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
- **Reference**: Represents an alias for another variable.

## 3. User Defined

User defined data types are types that are defined by the user to suit their requirements. They include:

- **Class**: Represents a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and functions.
- **Structure**: Represents a collection of variables under a single name, similar to a class but with public access by default.
- **Union**: Represents a special data type that allows storing different data types in the same memory location.
- **Enum**: Represents a set of named values, known as enumerators.

## Example Code

Here is an example of a simple expression involving variables and constants:

```cpp
sum = a + b + 10;
