# Lesson 1.7: Summary

In this first chapter, we’ve covered the essential basics of C++:

- **1.1 What is C++?**
  - C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language developed as an extension of C. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it highly versatile for building software, operating systems, games, and more.

- **1.2 Installing Visual C++**
  - Visual C++ is one of the most popular development environments for C++ programming. We explored how to download and install it, giving you the necessary tools to start coding.

- **1.3 Setting up**
  - After installation, we went through setting up a basic project in Visual Studio or any other IDE. You learned how to create a new project, select the C++ environment, and get ready to write your first program.

- **1.4 Creating and running a simple program**
  - We wrote our first C++ program: a "Hello, World!" application. This helped introduce the basic structure of a C++ program, including the `main()` function, headers, and statements.

- **1.5 Understanding C++ syntax and structure**
  - We discussed the essential syntax rules of C++, such as the importance of semicolons, the structure of functions, and the case sensitivity of the language. You learned how C++ code is structured with functions, statements, and comments.

- **1.6 Using input and output streams**
  - We introduced the use of `std::cin` and `std::cout` for handling input and output, respectively. You learned how to prompt the user for input and display output using the standard streams in C++.

This chapter has provided you with the foundational tools to write and run basic C++ programs. Moving forward, we’ll dive deeper into the language's features, starting with basic syntax elements, data types, and variables.
