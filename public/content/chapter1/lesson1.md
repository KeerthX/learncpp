# Lesson 1.1: What is C++?

## Objective
To understand what C++ is and its role in modern software development.

## Introduction to C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of C.  
It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it versatile for different types of applications.

## Key Features of C++

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ allows for the use of objects, which makes it ideal for large and complex systems.
- **Low-level Memory Manipulation:** C++ gives direct access to memory via pointers, making it highly efficient for system-level programming.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** C++ includes a rich library for data structures and algorithms.

## Common Uses of C++

- **System Software:** Operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.
- **Game Development:** Many games and gaming engines are built using C++ for its performance.
- **High-Performance Applications:** C++ is used in software where performance is critical, such as banking systems, telecommunications, and real-time processing.

## Why Learn C++?

Learning C++ provides a strong foundation for understanding other languages like Java, C#, and Python.  
Its concepts are fundamental to understanding more advanced software engineering principles.
